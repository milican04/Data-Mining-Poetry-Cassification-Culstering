seewith sinful eyes  for fear it to deflore is perfect beauty  which all men adore whose face and feature doth so much excelall mortal sense  that none the same may tell thereof as every earthly thing partakesor more or less  by influence divine so it more fair accordingly it makes and the gross matter of this earthly mine which clotheth it  thereafter doth refine doing away the dross which dims

such wondrous power that it can pierce through th eyes unto the heart and therein stir such rage and restless stour as nought but death can stint his dolours smart or can proportion of the outward partmove such affection in the inward mind that it can rob both sense and reason blind why do not then the blossoms of the field which are arrayd with much more orient hue and to the sense most dainty

there is more than so that works such wonders in the minds of men i  that have often provd  too well it know and whoso list the like assays to ken shall find by trial  and confess it then that beauty is not  as fond men misdeem an outward shew of things  that only seem for that same goodly hue of white and red with which the cheeks are sprinkled  shall decay and those sweet rosy leaves  so fairly spreadupon the lips  shall fade and fall awayto that they were  even to corrupted clay that golden wire  those sparkling stars so bright shall turn to dust  and lose their goodly light but that fair lamp  from whose celestial raythat light proceeds  which kindleth lovers fire shall never be extinguishd nor decay but when the vital spirits do expire unto her native planet shall retire for it is heavenly born and cannot die being a parcel of the purest sky for when the soul  the which derived was at first  out of that great immortal spright by whom all live to love  whilom did passdown from the top of purest heavens heightto be embodied here  it then took lightand lively spirits from that fairest star which lights the world forth from his fiery car which power retaining still or more or less when she in fleshly seed is eft enraced through every part she doth the same impress according as the heavens have her graced and frames her house  in which she will be placed fit for herself  adorning it with spoilof th heavenly riches which she robbd erewhile thereof it comes that these fair souls  which havethe most resemblance of that heavenly light frame to themselves most beautiful

is most pure and hath in it the more of heavenly light so it the fairer body doth procureto habit in  and it more fairly dightwith cheerful grace and amiable sight for of the soul the body form doth take for soul is form  and doth the body make therefore wherever that thou dost beholda comely corpse  with beauty fair endued know this for certain  that the same doth holda beauteous soul  with fair conditions thewed fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed for all that fair is  is by nature good that is a sign to know the gentle blood yet oft it falls that many a gentle minddwells in deformed tabernacle drownd either by chance  against the course of kind or through unaptness in the substance found which it assumed of some stubborn ground that will not yield unto her forms direction but is deformd with some foul imperfection and oft it falls   ay me  the more to rue that goodly beauty  albe heavenly born is foul abusd  and that celestial hue which doth the world with her delight adorn made but the bait of sin  and sinners scorn whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it but every one doth seek but to deprave it yet nathemore is that fair beautys blame but theirs that do abuse it unto ill nothing so good  but that through guilty shamemay be corrupt  and wrested unto will natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still however flesh  e s fault it filthy make for things immortal no corruption take but ye fair dames  the worlds dear ornamentsand lively images of heavens light let not your beams with such disparagementsbe dimmd  and your bright glory darkned quite but mindful still of your first countrys sight do still preserve your first informed grace whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face loathe that foul blot  that hellish firebrand disloyal lust  fair beautys foulest blame that base affections  which your ears would bland commend to you by loves abused name but is indeed the bondslave of defame which will the garland of your glory mar and quench the light of your bright shining star but gentle love  that loyal is and true will more illumine your resplendent ray and add more brightness to your goodly hue from light of his pure fire  which  by like waykindled of yours  your likeness doth display like as two mirrors  by opposd reflection do both express the faces first impression therefore  to make your beauty more appear it you behoves to love  and forth to laythat heavenly riches which in you ye bear that men the more admire their fountain may for else what booteth that celestial ray if it in darkness be enshrined ever that it of loving eyes be viewed never but  in your choice of loves  this well advise that likest to yourselves ye them select the which your forms first source may sympathize and with like beautys parts be inly deckt for  if you loosely love without respect it is no love  but a discordant war whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar for love is a celestial harmonyof likely hearts composd of stars concent which join together in sweet sympathy to work each others joy and true content which they have harbourd since their first descentout of their heavenly bowers  where they did seeand know each other here belovd to be then wrong it were that any other twainshould in loves gentle band combined bebut those whom heaven did at first ordain and made out of one mould the more t agree for all that like the beauty which they see straight do not love  for love is not so lightas straight to burn at first beholders sight but they  which love indeed  look otherwise with pure regard and spotless true intent drawing out of the object of their eyesa more refined form  which they presentunto their mind  void of all blemishment which it reducing to her first perfection beholdeth free from fleshs frail infection and then conforming it unto the light which in itself it hath remaining still of that first sun  yet sparkling in his sight thereof he fashions in his higher skillan heavenly beauty to his fancys will and it embracing in his mind entire the mirror of his own thought doth admire which seeing now so inly fair to be as outward it appeareth to the eye and with his spirits proportion to agree he thereon fixeth all his fantasy and fully setteth his felicity counting it fairer than it is indeed and yet indeed her fairness doth exceed for lovers eyes more sharply sighted bethan other mens  and in dear loves delightsee more than any other eyes can see through mutual receipt of beam  e s bright which carry privy message to the spright and to their eyes that inmost fair display as plain as light discovers dawning day therein they see  through amorous eye glances armies of loves still flying to and fro which dart at them their little fiery lances whom having wounded  back again they go carrying compassion to their lovely foe who  seeing her fair eyes so sharp effect cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect in which how many wonders do they redeto their conceit  that others never see now of her smiles  with which their souls they feed like gods with nectar in their banquets free now of her looks  which like to cordials be but when her words embassade forth she sends lord  how sweet music that unto them lends sometimes upon her forehead they beholda thousand graces masking in delight sometimes within her eyelids they unfoldten thousand sweet belgards  which

ford madox ford,i gloom  an october like november  august a hundred thousand hours  and all september  a hundred thousand  dragging sunlit days  and half october like a thousand years       and doom  that then was antwerp      in the name of god  how could they do it  those souls that usually dived into the dirty caverns of mines  who usually hived in whitened hovels  under ragged poplars  who dragged muddy shovels  over the grassy mud  lumbering to work over the greasy sods      those men there  with the appearance of clods were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of god ever shrived      and it is not for us to make them an anthem  if we found words there would come no wind that would fan them to a tune that the trumpets might blow it  shrill through the heaven thats ours or yet allahs  or the wide halls of any valhallas  we can make no such anthem  so that all that is ours for inditing in sonnets  pantoums  elegiacs  or lays is this  in the name of god  how could they do it  ii for there is no new thing under the sun  only this uncomely man with a smoking gun in the gloom      what the devil will he gain by it  digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it waiting his doom  the sharp blow  the swift outpouring of the blood  till the trench of gray mud is turned to a brown purple drain by it  well  there have been scars won in many wars      punic  lacedmonian  wars of napoleon  wars for faith  wars for honour  for love  for possession  but this belgian man in his ugly tunic  his ugly round cap  shooting on  in a sort of obsession  overspreading his miserable land  standing with his wet gun in his hand       doom  he finds that in a sudden scrimmage  and lies  an unsightly lump on the sodden grass       an image that shall take long to pass  iii for the white limbed heroes of hellas ride by upon their horses forever through our brains  the heroes of cressy ride by upon their stallions  and battalions and battalions and battalions the old guard  the young guard  the men of minden and of waterloo  pass  for ever staunch  stand  for ever true  and the small man with the large paunch  and the gray coat  and the large hat  and the hands behind the back  watches them pass in our minds for ever       but that clutter of sodden corses on the sodden belgian grass that is a strange new beauty  iv with no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty  assuredly that is the way of it  the way of beauty       and that is the highest word you can find to say of it  for you cannot praise it with words compounded of lyres and swords  but the thought of the gloom and the rain and the ugly coated figure  standing beside a drain  shall eat itself into your brain  and you will say of all heroes  they fought like the belgians  and you will say  he wrought like a belgian his fate out of gloom  and you will say  he bought like a belgian his doom  and that shall be an honourable name  belgian shall be an honourable word  as honourable as the fame of the sword  as honourable as the mention of the many chorded lyre  and his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in tyre  v and what in the world did they bear it for  i dont know  and what in the world did they dare it for  perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand  they could very well have watched a hundred legions go over their fields and between their cities down into more southerly regions  they could very well have let the legions pass through their woods  and have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods  i dont understand  was it just love of their land  oh  poor dears  can any man so love his land  give them a thousand thousand pities and rivers and rivers of tears to wash off the blood from the cities of flanders  vi this is charing cross  it is midnight  there is a great crowd and no light  a great crowd  all black that hardly whispers aloud  surely  that is a dead womana dead mother  she has a dead face  she is dressed all in black  she wanders to the bookstall and back  at the back of the crowd  and back again and again back  she sways and wanders  this

mother  and there is another and another and another      and little children  all in black  all with dead faces  waiting in all the waiting places  wandering from the doors of the waiting room in the

t  s  eliot,let us go then  you and i when the evening is spread out against the skylike a patient etherized upon a table let us go  through certain half deserted streets the muttering retreatsof restless nights in one night cheap hotelsand sawdust restaurants with oyster shells streets that follow like a tedious argumentof insidious intentto lead you to an overwhelming question    oh  do not ask  what is it let us go and make our visit in the room the women come and gotalking of michelangelo the yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes the yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window panes licked its tongue into the corners of the evening lingered upon the pools that stand in drains let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys slipped by the terrace  made a sudden leap and seeing that it was a soft october night curled once about the house  and fell asleep and indeed there will be timefor the yellow smoke that slides along the street rubbing its back upon the window panes there will be time  there will be timeto prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet there will be time to murder and create and time for all the works and days of handsthat lift and drop a question on your plate time for you and time for me and time yet for a hundred indecisions and for a hundred visions and revisions before the taking of a toast and tea in the room the women come and gotalking of michelangelo and indeed there will be timeto wonder  do i dare  and  do i dare time to turn back and descend the stair with a bald spot in the middle of my hair  they will say  how his hair is growing thin  my morning coat  my collar mounting firmly to the chin my necktie rich and modest  but asserted by a simple pin  they will say  but how his arms and legs are thin  do i daredisturb the universe in a minute there is timefor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse for i have known them all already  known them all have known the evenings  mornings  afternoons i have measured out my life with coffee spoons i know the voices dying with a dying fallbeneath the music from a farther room  so how should i presume and i have known the eyes already  known them allthe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase and when i am formulated  sprawling on a pin when i am pinned and wriggling on the wall then how should i beginto spit out all the butt ends of my days and ways  and how should i presume and i have known the arms already  known them allarms that are braceleted and white and bare but in the lamplight  downed with light brown hair  is it perfume from a dressthat makes me so digress arms that lie along a table  or wrap about a shawl  and should i then presume  and how should i begin shall i say  i have gone at dusk through narrow streetsand watched the smoke that rises from the pipesof lonely men in shirt sleeves  leaning out of windows     i should have been a pair of ragged clawsscuttling across the floors of silent seas and the afternoon  the evening  sleeps so peacefully smoothed by long fingers asleep     tired     or it malingers stretched on the floor  here beside you and me should i  after tea and cakes and ices have the strength to force the moment to its crisis but though i have wept and fasted  wept and prayed though i have seen my head  grown slightly bald  brought in upon a platter i am no prophetand heres no great matter i have seen the moment of my greatness flicker and i have seen the eternal footman hold my coat  and snicker and in short  i was afraid and would it have been worth it  after all after the cups  the marmalade  the tea among the porcelain  among some talk of you and me would it have been worth while to have bitten off the matter with a smile to have squeezed the universe into a ballto roll it towards some overwhelming question to say  i am lazarus  come from the dead come back to tell you all  i shall tell you allif one  settling a pillow by her head should say  that is not what i meant at all  that is not it  at all and would it have been worth it  after all would it have been worth while after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets after the novels  after the teacups  after the skirts that trail along the floorand this  and so much more it is impossible to say just what i mean but as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen would it have been worth whileif one  settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl and turning toward the window  should say  that is not it at all  that is not what i meant  at all no  i am not prince hamlet  nor was meant to be am an attendant lord  one that will doto swell a progress  start a scene or two advise the prince  no doubt  an easy tool deferential  glad to be of use politic  cautious  and meticulous full of high sentence  but a bit obtuse at times  indeed  almost ridiculousalmost  at times  the fool i grow old     i grow old    i shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled shall i part my hair behind  do i dare to eat a peach i shall wear white flannel trousers  and walk upon the beach i have heard the mermaids singing  each to each i do not think that they will sing to me i have seen them riding seaward on the wavescombing the white hair of the waves blown backwhen the wind blows the water white and black we have lingered in the chambers of the seaby sea girls wreathed
